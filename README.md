# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This project enhances driver drowsiness detection using video footage from a driving simulator. A webcam captures the participantâ€™s face, allowing tracking of their transition from alertness to drowsiness. By detecting the eyes and mouth, the system measures if the eyes are closed for 15 seconds, indicating drowsiness.
